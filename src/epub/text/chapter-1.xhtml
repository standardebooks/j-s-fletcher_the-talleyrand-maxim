			</hgroup>
			<p>Linford Pratt, senior clerk to Eldrick &amp; Pascoe, solicitors, of Barford, a young man who earnestly desired to get on in life, by hook or by crook, with no objection whatever to crookedness, so long as it could be performed in safety and secrecy, had once during one of his periodical visits to the town Reference Library, lighted on a maxim of that other unscrupulous person, Prince Talleyrand, which had pleased him greatly. “With time and patience,” said Talleyrand, “the mulberry leaf is turned into satin.” This seemed to Linford Pratt one of the finest and soundest pieces of wisdom which he had ever known put into words.</p>
			<p>A mulberry leaf is a very insignificant thing, but a piece of satin is a highly marketable commodity, with money in it. Henceforth, he regarded himself as a mulberry leaf which his own wit and skill must transform into satin: at the same time he knew that there is another thing, in addition to time and patience, which is valuable to young men of his peculiar qualities, a thing also much beloved by Talleyrand⁠—opportunity. He could find the patience, and he had the time⁠—but it would give him great happiness if opportunity came along to help in the work. In everyday language, Linford Pratt wanted a chance⁠—he waited the arrival of the tide in his affairs which would lead him on to fortune.</p>
			<p>Leave him alone⁠—he said to himself⁠—to be sure to take it at the flood. If Pratt had only known it, as he stood in the outer office of Eldrick &amp; Pascoe at the end of a certain winter afternoon, opportunity was slowly climbing the staircase outside⁠—not only opportunity, but temptation, both assisted by the Devil. They came at the right moment, for Pratt was alone; the partners had gone: the other clerks had gone: the office-boy had gone: in another minute Pratt would have gone, too: he was only looking round before locking up for the night. Then these things came⁠—combined in the person of an old man, Antony Bartle, who opened the door, pushed in a queer, wrinkled face, and asked in a quavering voice if anybody was in.</p>
			<p>“I’m in, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartle,” answered Pratt, turning up a gas jet which he had just lowered. “Come in, sir. What can I do for you?”</p>
			<p>Antony Bartle came in, wheezing and coughing. He was a very, very old man, feeble and bent, with little that looked alive about him but his light, alert eyes. Everybody knew him⁠—he was one of the institutions of Barford⁠—as well known as the Town Hall or the Parish Church. For fifty years he had kept a secondhand bookshop in Quagg Alley, the narrow passageway which connected Market Street with Beck Street. It was not by any means a common or ordinary secondhand bookshop: its proprietor styled himself an “antiquarian bookseller”; and he had a reputation in two Continents, and dealt with millionaire buyers and virtuosos in both.</p>
			<p>Barford people sometimes marvelled at the news that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Antony Bartle had given two thousand guineas for a Book of Hours, and had sold a Missal for twice that amount to some American collector; and they got a hazy notion that the old man must be well-to-do⁠—despite his snuffiness and shabbiness, and that his queer old shop, in the window of which there was rarely anything to be seen but a few ancient tomes, and two or three rare engravings, contained much that he could turn at an hour’s notice into gold. All that was surmise⁠—but Eldrick &amp; Pascoe⁠—which term included Linford Pratt⁠—knew all about Antony Bartle, being his solicitors: his will was safely deposited in their keeping, and Pratt had been one of the attesting witnesses.</p>
			<p>The old man, having slowly walked into the outer office, leaned against a table, panting a little. Pratt hastened to open an inner door.</p>
			<p>“Come into <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Eldrick’s room, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartle,” he said. “There’s a nice easy chair there⁠—come and sit down in it. Those stairs are a bit trying, aren’t they? I often wish we were on the ground floor.”</p>
			<p>He lighted the gas in the senior partner’s room, and turning back, took hold of the visitor’s arm, and helped him to the easy chair. Then, having closed the doors, he sat down at Eldrick’s desk, put his fingers together and waited. Pratt knew from experience that old Antony Bartle would not have come there except on business: he knew also, having been at Eldrick &amp; Pascoe’s for many years, that the old man would confide in him as readily as in either of his principals.</p>
			<p>“There’s a nasty fog coming on outside,” said Bartle, after a fit of coughing. “It gets on my lungs, and then it makes my heart bad. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Eldrick in?”</p>
			<p>“Gone,” replied Pratt. “All gone, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartle⁠—only me here.”</p>
			<p>“You’ll do,” answered the old bookseller. “You’re as good as they are.” He leaned forward from the easy chair, and tapped the clerk’s arm with a long, claw-like finger. “I say,” he continued, with a smile that was something between a wink and a leer, and suggestive of a pleased satisfaction. “I’ve had a find!”</p>
			<p>“Oh!” responded Pratt. “One of your rare books, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartle? Got something for twopence that you’ll sell for ten guineas? You’re one of the lucky ones, you know, you are!”</p>
			<p>“Nothing of the sort!” chuckled Bartle. “And I had to pay for my knowledge, young man, before I got it⁠—we all have. No⁠—but I’ve found something: not half an hour ago. Came straight here with it. Matters for lawyers, of course.”</p>
			<p>“Yes?” said Pratt inquiringly. “And⁠—what may it be?” He was expecting the visitor to produce something, but the old man again leaned forward, and dug his finger once more into the clerk’s sleeve.</p>
			<p>“I say!” he whispered. “You remember John Mallathorpe and the affair of⁠—how long is it since?”</p>
			<p>“Two years,” answered Pratt promptly. “Of course I do. Couldn’t very well forget it, or him.”</p>
			<p>He let his mind go back for the moment to an affair which had provided Barford and the neighbourhood with a nine days’ sensation. One winter morning, just two years previously, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> John Mallathorpe, one of the best-known manufacturers and richest men of the town, had been killed by the falling of his own mill-chimney. The condition of the chimney had been doubtful for some little time; experts had been examining it for several days: at the moment of the catastrophe, Mallathorpe himself, some of his principal managers, and a couple of professional steeplejacks, were gathered at its base, consulting on a report. The great hundred-foot structure above them had collapsed without the slightest warning: Mallathorpe, his principal manager, and his cashier, had been killed on the spot: two other bystanders had subsequently died from injuries received. No such accident had occurred in Barford, nor in the surrounding manufacturing district, for many years, and there had been much interest in it, for according to the expert’s conclusions the chimney was in no immediate danger.</p>
			<p>Other mill-owners then began to examine their chimneys, and for many weeks Barford folk had talked of little else than the danger of living in the shadows of these great masses of masonry.</p>
			<p>But there had soon been something else to talk of. It sprang out of the accident⁠—and it was of particular interest to persons who, like Linford Pratt, were of the legal profession. John Mallathorpe, so far as anybody knew or could ascertain, had died intestate. No solicitor in the town had ever made a will for him. No solicitor elsewhere had ever made a will for him. No one had ever heard that he had made a will for himself. There was no will. Drastic search of his safes, his desks, his drawers revealed nothing⁠—not even a memorandum. No friend of his had ever heard him mention a will. He had always been something of a queer man. He was a confirmed bachelor. The only relation he had in the world was his sister-in-law, the widow of his deceased younger brother, and her two children⁠—a son and a daughter. And as soon as he was dead, and it was plain that he had died intestate, they put in their claim to his property.</p>
			<p>John Mallathorpe had left a handsome property. He had been making money all his life. His business was a considerable one⁠—he employed two thousand workpeople. His average annual profit from his mills was reckoned in thousands⁠—four or five thousands at least. And some years before his death, he had bought one of the finest estates in the neighbourhood, Normandale Grange, a beautiful old house, set amidst charming and romantic scenery in a valley, which, though within twelve miles of Barford, might have been in the heart of the Highlands. Therefore, it was no small thing that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Richard Mallathorpe and her two children laid claim to. Up to the time of John Mallathorpe’s death, they had lived in very humble fashion⁠—lived, indeed, on an allowance from their well-to-do kinsman⁠—for Richard Mallathorpe had been as much of a waster as his brother had been of a money-getter. And there was no withstanding their claim when it was finally decided that John Mallathorpe had died intestate⁠—no withstanding that, at any rate, of the nephew and niece. The nephew had taken all the real estate: he and his sister had shared the personal property. And for some months they and their mother had been safely installed at Normandale Grange, and in full possession of the dead man’s wealth and business.</p>
			<p>All this flashed through Linford Pratt’s mind in a few seconds⁠—he knew all the story: he had often thought of the extraordinary good fortune of those young people. To be living on charity one week⁠—and the next to be legal possessors of thousands a year!⁠—oh, if only such luck would come his way!</p>
			<p>“Of course!” he repeated, looking thoughtfully at the old bookseller. “Not the sort of thing one does forget in a hurry, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartle. What of it?”</p>
			<p>Antony Bartle leaned back in his easy chair and chuckled⁠—something, some idea, seemed to be affording him amusement.</p>
			<p>“I’m eighty years old,” he remarked. “No, I’m more, to be exact. I shall be eighty-two come February. When you’ve lived as long as that, young <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pratt, you’ll know that this life is a game of topsy-turvy⁠—to some folks, at any rate. Just so!”</p>
			<p>“You didn’t come here to tell me that, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartle,” said Pratt. He was an essentially practical young man who dined at half-past six every evening, having lunched on no more than bread-and-cheese and a glass of ale, and he also had his evenings well mapped out. “I know that already, sir.”</p>
			<p>“Aye, aye, but you’ll know more of it later on,” replied Bartle. “Well⁠—you know, too, no doubt, that the late John Mallathorpe was a bit⁠—only a bit⁠—of a book-collector; collected books and pamphlets relating to this district?”</p>
			<p>“I’ve heard of it,” answered the clerk.</p>
			<p>“He had that collection in his private room at the mill,” continued the old bookseller, “and when the new folks took hold, I persuaded them to sell it to me. There wasn’t such a lot⁠—maybe a hundred volumes altogether⁠—but I wanted what there was. And as they were of no interest to them, they sold ’em. That’s some months ago. I put all the books in a corner⁠—and I never really examined them until this very afternoon. Then⁠—by this afternoon’s post⁠—I got a letter from a Barford man who’s now out in America. He wanted to know if I could supply him with a nice copy of Hopkinson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Barford</i>. I knew there was one in that Mallathorpe collection, so I got it out, and examined it. And in the pocket inside, in which there’s a map, I found⁠—what d’ye think?”</p>
			<p>“Couldn’t say,” replied Pratt. He was still thinking of his dinner, and of an important engagement to follow it, and he had not the least idea that old Antony Bartle was going to tell him anything very important. “Letters? Banknotes? Something of that sort?”</p>
			<p>The old bookseller leaned nearer, across the corner of the desk, until his queer, wrinkled face was almost close to Pratt’s sharp, youthful one. Again he lifted the claw-like finger: again he tapped the clerk’s arm.</p>
			<p>“I found John Mallathorpe’s will!” he whispered. “His⁠—will!”</p>
			<p>Linford Pratt jumped out of his chair. For a second he stared in speechless amazement at the old man; then he plunged his hands deep into his trousers’ pockets, opened his mouth, and let out a sudden exclamation.</p>
			<p>“No!” he said. “No! John Mallathorpe’s⁠—will? His⁠—will!”</p>
			<p>“Made the very day on which he died,” answered Bartle, nodding emphatically.</p>
			<p>“Queer, wasn’t it? He might have had some⁠—premonition, eh?”</p>
			<p>Pratt sat down again.</p>
			<p>“Where is it?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Here in my pocket,” replied the old bookseller, tapping his rusty coat. “Oh, it’s all right, I assure you. All duly made out, signed, and witnessed. Everything in order, I know!⁠—because a long, a very long time ago, I was like you, an attorney’s clerk. I’ve drafted many a will, and witnessed many a will, in my time. I’ve read this, every word of it⁠—it’s all right. Nothing can upset it.”</p>
			<p>“Let’s see it,” said Pratt, eagerly.</p>
			<p>“Well⁠—I’ve no objection⁠—I know you, of course,” answered Bartle, “but I’d rather show it first to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Eldrick. Couldn’t you telephone up to his house and ask him to run back here?”</p>
			<p>“Certainly,” replied Pratt. “He mayn’t be there, though. But I can try. You haven’t shown it to anybody else?”</p>
			<p>“Neither shown it to anybody, nor mentioned it to a soul,” said Bartle. “I tell you it’s not much more than half an hour since I found it. It’s not a long document. Do you know how it is that it’s never come out?” he went on, turning eagerly to Pratt, who had risen again. “It’s easily explained. The will’s witnessed by those two men who were killed at the same time as John Mallathorpe! So, of course, there was nobody to say that it was in evidence. My notion is that he and those two men⁠—Gaukrodger and Marshall, his manager and cashier⁠—had signed it not long before the accident, and that Mallathorpe had popped it into the pocket of that book before going out into the yard. Eh? But see if you can get <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Eldrick down here, and we’ll read it together. And I say⁠—this office seems uncommonly stuffy⁠—can you open the window a bit or something?⁠—I feel oppressed, like.”</p>
			<p>Pratt opened a window which looked out on the street. He glanced at the old man for a moment and saw that his face, always pallid, was even paler than usual.</p>
			<p>“You’ve been talking too much,” he said. “Rest yourself, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartle, while I ring up <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Eldrick’s house. If he isn’t there, I’ll try his club⁠—he often turns in there for an hour before going home.”</p>
			<p>He went out by a private door to the telephone box, which stood in a lobby used by various occupants of the building. And when he had rung up Eldrick’s private house and was waiting for the answer, he asked himself what this discovery would mean to the present holders of the Mallathorpe property, and his curiosity⁠—a strongly developed quality in him⁠—became more and more excited. If Eldrick was not at home, if he could not get in touch with him, he would persuade old Bartle to let him see his find⁠—he would cheerfully go late to his dinner if he could only get a peep at this strangely discovered document. Romance! Why, this indeed was romance; and it might be⁠—what else? Old Bartle had already chuckled about topsy-turvydom: did that mean that⁠—</p>
			<p>The telephone bell rang: Eldrick had not yet reached his house. Pratt got on to the club: Eldrick had not been there. He rang off, and went back to the private room.</p>
			<p>“Can’t get hold of him, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartle,” he began, as he closed the door. “He’s not at home, and he’s not at the club. I say!⁠—you might as well let me have a look at⁠—”</p>
			<p>Pratt suddenly stopped. There was a strange silence in the room: the old man’s wheezy breathing was no longer heard. And the clerk moved forward quickly and looked round the high back of the easy chair.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>He knew at once what had happened⁠—knew that old Bartle was dead before he laid a finger on the wasted hand which had dropped helplessly at his side. He had evidently died without a sound or a movement⁠—died as quietly as he would have gone to sleep. Indeed, he looked as if he had just laid his old head against the padding of the chair and dropped asleep, and Pratt, who had seen death before, knew that he would never wake again. He waited a moment, listening in the silence. Once he touched the old man’s hand; once, he bent nearer, still listening. And then, without hesitation, and with fingers that remained as steady as if nothing had happened, he unbuttoned Antony Bartle’s coat, and drew a folded paper from the inner pocket.</p>
